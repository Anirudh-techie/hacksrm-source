## Runtime Meet | All in one application for conducting best meetings around the globe

We have developed our super cool video conferencing applicatio that would helpmyou join meeting around the globe. We are in the making of the app nas a product. Now itself, we have created the feature that help the students and teacher join a meeting of a school simply by selecting school and selecting grade. We can see the meetings of the grade of that school and join without writing long codes.

## What we are planning next?

We are gonna create a super cool project that would really help the teachers, as well as students in the time of pandemic and class, are going virtual. So, a majority of teachers are getting confused because of reasons like ‘Are they paying attention to me’ or ‘Is my class clear to all’ etc. So, we are gonna help teachers by introducing 5 super-awesome features to our virtual classroom.

1. The teacher can know who all are listening to her without even rotating her cameras to everyone’s cameras. We do this through face recognition of the student camera and detects whether he is listening or not.
2. The instructor can take attendance of her students easily by clicking the take attendance button and our app automatically takes attendance and gives her who all are present and absent.
3. The teacher can share the resources like the Youtube video which help the student, the websites he could get the books to refer to, etc. The student can download all the resources during and after class.
4. The student is able to record all that his teacher teaches so that he could again hear what he is taught and solve all his doubts.
5. The joining of the meeting becomes so simpler that the student just have to select his grade

We are also planning to make more features. All are on the way.
